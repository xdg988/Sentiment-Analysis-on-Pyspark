5.0	"b""I *adore* Travis at the Hard Rock's new Kelly Cardenas Salon!  I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  \n\nTravis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! \n\nNext Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! \n\nTravis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.  You make me feel beauuuutiful!"""

The dental assistants that helped in my procedure were amazing, Jewel and Bailey helped me to feel comfortable!  I don't have dental insurance, but they have this insurance through their office you can purchase for $80 something a year and this gave me 25% off all of my dental work, plus they helped me get signed up for care credit which I knew nothing about before this visit!  I highly recommend this office for the nice synergy the whole office has!"""

Very happy with her.\n\nIn summation, a great pub experience. Would go again!"""
1.0	"b'Today was my second out of three sessions I had paid for. Although my first session went well, I could tell Meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. However, I returned because she did my teeth fine and I was pleased with the results. When I went in today, I was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. My appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, I always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. Unbothered by those signs, I waited my turn. She checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if I was ok. She attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if I had any irritation. Half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. While she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. So, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. While I sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. Not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. When my light turned off, I released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming I was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. At this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. I began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. I was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room I was already out of my chair. She finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin E on my gum burn (pictured below). At this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and I was so irritated that I had to suffer, all I wanted was to leave. While I waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. Saying, ""well burns come with teeth whitening."" While I totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so I could let her know. Not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn\'t even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. Her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but I had the light off for a solid two minutes before I couldn\'t stand the pain. She admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. Her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because I wanted to leave after the way I was treated. I also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact I won\'t be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. She was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and I were down the steps. I have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman\'s behavior, who claims to be in the business for ""10 years."" Admit your wrongs, but don\'t make your guest feel unwelcome because you can\'t do you job properly.'"
4.0	"b'I\'ll be the first to admit that I was not excited about going to La Tavolta. Being a food snob, when a group of friends suggested we go for dinner I looked online at the menu and to me there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced.  Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out. Alas, I was outnumbered. Thank goodness! I ordered the sea bass special. It was to die for. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion. I can not say enough good things about this dish. When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said, "" doesn\'t she (the chef) do an incredible job?"" She does. \n\nMy hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his. I heard ""mmmm this is so good"" from all around the table. Our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the place was PACKED but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn\'t seem to bother anyone.\n\nSo-\n\nDo order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers. Leave out the mussels. \n\nIf they have the sea bass special, I highly recommend it. The chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big. The chicken Romano was a bit bland. The house salads were teeny. \n\nDo make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food. Go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud. Don\'t go with a date unless you\'re fighting and don\'t feel like hearing anything they have to say.  Ask to sit in the side room if it\'s available.'"
3.0	"b""Tracy dessert had a big name in Hong Kong and the one in First Markham place has been here for many years now! \n\nCame in for some Chinese dessert, and I must say their selection has increased tremendously over the years. I might as well add that the price has also increased tremendously as well. The waitress gave us tea, which I could taste had red date in it. Fancy!\n\nA simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like $5.25 or something. Basically all the desserts were more than $5. That's crazy! I can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl, it would probably cost like $0.50. A few years ago, I think I can still get it for like $3-$4, which is more reasonable, but wow, more than $5 is a little over the top for this dessert. Though I must say, it is Tracy Dessert, and they are a little more on the expensive side. \n\nI also saw other items on the menu like fish balls, chicken wings, shaved ice. My friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it! \n\nI'm also surprised how many people come to Tracy Dessert after work. We came on a Sunday and the tables were always filled. I think the amount of tables they had were just perfect because no one really waited for seats for a long time, but the tables kept filling up once a table was finished."""
1.0	"b""This place has gone down hill.  Clearly they have cut back on staff and food quality\n\nMany of the reviews were written before the menu changed.  I've been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill.\n\nThe service is slow & my salad, which was $15, was as bad as it gets.\n\nIt's just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options."""
2.0	"b'I was really looking forward to visiting after having some of their beers. The ""Man O\'War"" quickly became my favorite DIPA; the Rusulka Vanilla Stout is a good thick, sweet stout; and the Ironclad is a top notch IPA. \nThe only big miss on their beers I\'ve had is the Big Chuck Barleywine. It could probably benefit greatly with age, but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol.  \nNonetheless, I had enough to convince me that the other beers I hadn\'t had from them would be top notch... and they are! \nThe reason for the 2 stars should not reflect the quality of the brewers, they obviously know their craft well! \nThe servers are great and friendly.... but relying on two servers to wait on 100+ customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be. In fact, after waiting 15 mins at a dirty table I was finally able to track down someone I guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there! \nAfter another 5+ mins, the GM finally stopped over to take our drink order. The smugness of this guy was amazing. The thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head. \nThis is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the non-final check left by the party before us... who didn\'t seem very pleased when leaving. \nThe toast & cheese was good, but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food, saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing.'"

4.0	"b'Like walking back in time, every Saturday morning my sister and I was in a bowling league and after we were done, we\'d spend a few quarters playing the pin ball machines until our mother came to pick us up.\n\nMy sister was daring and play the machines hard, she was afraid of that ""tilt"" showing up and freezing the game.  I, on the other hand was a bit more gentler and wanted to make sure I got my quarter\'s worth.\n\nThis place has rows and rows of machines, some are really old and some are more of a mid 80\'s theme.  There is even a Ms pac man!  It was fun to spend an afternoon playing the machines and remembering all the fun of my early teen years.'"
1.0	"b""Walked in around 4 on a Friday afternoon, we sat at a table just off the bar and walked out after 5 min or so. Don't even think they realized we walked in.

Oh well, the location they are at has been about 5 different things over the past several years, so they will just be added to the list. SMDH!!!"""
4.0	"b""Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably. \nI wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back. \nGive it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews. \nA bottle of Riesling, calamari app, two delicious entrees and dessert for $92! \nWell with it."""

1.0	"b""I cannot believe how things have changed in 3 years. I picked up duck congee sometime in the winter when my hubby was sick.  I was very disappointed because the ginger fish sauce tasted like it had gone bad (it should never be bitter).  Today, my hubby wanted to eat there since he was craving the duck congee and most places don't serve the duck & coleslaw side. We waited about 10 minutes to get our menu.  After we placed our orders, we waited another 5 minutes to get the tea that most places bring with the menu.  I could go on with the details but the gist of the story is they were understaffed or the staff was slow.  The worst part of it was that the service.  The servers make us feel bad for asking for anything (like when they took our order).  We had arrived and placed our order before another couple bside us at least 10 minutes ahead but somehow, this couple received their pho before mine.  They were almost done eating their pho before mine came out."""
5.0	"b""You can't really find anything wrong with this place, the pastas and pizzas are both amazing and high quality, the price is very reasonable, the owner and the staff are very friendly, if you're in downtown check this place out, a lot of people think just because it's downtown there are lots of options around but that's not always the case as there is also a lot of poor quality food in downtown as well."""
4.0	b'Great lunch today. Staff was very helpful in assisting with selections and knowledgeable on the ingredients. We enjoyed the BBQ chicken with tika masala sauce and really good naan bread. The biryani with chicken was also yummy! Fun to see the food being prepared in the tandoori ovens. Great addition to the fast casual scene in Cleveland.'
3.0	"b'I love chinese food and I love mexican food. What can go wrong? A couple of things. First things first, this place is more of a ""rice bowl"" kind of place. I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.\n\nI\'m gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. I don\'t think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does, but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside, i\'d give it a ""C"" grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room. \n\nMmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren\'t sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me. \n\nThe jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald\'s apple pie. If you order the burrito, be warned that it\'s a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty. \n\nThey provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special. \n\nNot gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside. I used the bathroom like 5 times. I don\'t recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day.'"

I couldn't even finish the last piece of chicken after experiencing a salt overload.\n\nSecond time we came on a wednesday. We didn't know it was BBQ night, where they have a completely different menu, and don't offer anything from their original vegetarian-friendly menu. This menu has one vegetarian-friendly option - an eggplant sandwich. The vegetarian in my party said it was awful. Also, on BBQ night you choose 2 sides. Except they were out of all their sides except 2 - fries and potato salad. I can't say I was thrilled to have carb heavy sides with my carb heavy main. How do you run out of sides so early in the evening?\n\nService not so great.\n\nI'd avoid coming here on wednesdays."""

The best part is that they are hand pinched by a group of older Polish and Hungarian women. \nThe biggest seller is potato and cheese but they sell many flavors. They are like plump pillows of softness. You can buy them buy the dozen. You can get them cold to take home and freeze or warm and ready to eat. The warm ones are served with butter and onions.

The staff is completely unprofessional and I have never been treated so rudely in my life.  I was actually shocked and walked away thinking ""wow, how do those people even have a job?""\n\nI have never written a negative review before, I usually chalk it up to someone having a bad day.  I have worked in customer service for 10+ years and I know it is exhausting and bad days happen.  But this is a special occasion.\n\nI drove 30 minutes to try to find someone who could help me repair a watch band.  I was barely greeted upon arrival and right away felt like I was bothering them.  The girl behind the counter obviously just wanted me to leave, the blond kid working snapped at me when I asked a question and when I re-asked in order to clarify what he said he snapped again and said, ""I already told you?!?""  ""Is this even authentic?""  Shouting at me over his shoulder as he work on something else. \n\nI was shocked and just stood there put my watch away awkwardly and left with no one else saying a word to me.

1.0	"b""This review is in regards to our experience watching SuperBowl 51 February 5, 2017 at the WestGate in the theater/auditorium.\n\nWatch the game somewhere else.....\n\nTo those unfamiliar with The Big Game experience at WestGate you typically would get in line to watch the Superbowl in the theater portion of the hotel around 8 am on Superbowl Sunday. This line can get extremely long yet the earlier you get in line your choice of seating significantly improves.So...after waiting in line for a few hours we were notified the lower portion of the theater was reserved for paid customers who previously purchased wristbands for $100 (including alcohol and hot dogs) and instead we would be seated in the balcony portion of the theater.No problem, something different, we said. Mistake.\n\nSo at 1:30 pm we were sent upstairs to the balcony to take our seats and prepare to watch the big game at 3:30. Once we take our seats one of us ( we're in a group of 8 ) will hold the seats while the rest of us will go out to the casino floor and gamble or go the the sports book and place a couple last minute bets.Please note the patrons that leave the auditorium will receive a hand stamp or wristband to allow reentry to the theater. BUT INSTEAD....\n\nWe were told by Westgate staff that no hand stamps or wristbands would be given and we were ON OUR OWN if we choose to leave and we would not be allowed back in. Wow.\nThat's right, after waiting in line all morning if we wanted to go downstairs to play blackjack, place a bet at the book, or maybe have a bite to eat because no food was made available upstairs we would be out of luck. Nice work Westgate.\n\nSo we were seated upstairs...stuck. With no food or soda available for purchase. Only beer and water was sold in the balcony food counter. That was at 1:45 p.m. After vigorously complaining to Westgate staff ( to ushers with yellow jackets and security with black jackets ) at 3:04 pm wristbands were given out. At 3:18 hot dogs and soda were made available for sale in the balcony. I believe this was a direct result of all the upset patrons like myself that were seated in the balcony level.\n\nIn summary, for being the biggest sportbook in Las Vegas this place is dysfunction and fails to satisfy the most basic request to provide food and comfort to betting patrons. A total mess. This place sucks. Watch the big game and bet your money some where else. We will."""

1.0	"b'I tried this place because my girls are away for a month, and I REALLY wanted to try to wait until they came back, because NOBODY can hold a candle to them, but my toes were desperate.  When I went in, they were almost twice what I usually pay to begin with.  Then, before starting the pedicure, I specifically told them I already had gel polish on my toes.  They didn\'t tell me right then and there ""that will be an extra $5\'.  No, they waited until it was time to pay, and not only charged me for that, but they charged me all kinds of extra fees that I didn\'t even ask for!  I had also informed the girl that my toenail was loose and needed gluing.  While I was looking at my phone, all of a sudden I felt this sensation, and she RIPPED OFF MY TOENAIL!!!!  Without even asking me!!!!!!  So then she had another girl come and put acrylic on there since the nail underneath was only 1/2 grown.  Again, they didn\'t tell me how much this would be, or even ask my permission, they just charged me at the end.  \n\nThe added stone \'massage\' was barely a massage!  She rubbed the stones up my lower legs a couple times, and that was it.  It lasted about 30 seconds.   And when I asked for a design, I\'m used to getting a board with a bunch of designs to choose from.  She didn\'t even ask me what I wanted, she just painted a few lines on my two toes and then charge me 5 MORE dollars for that! \n\nUgh, I don\'t care HOW ugly my toes look next time, I will NEVER go anywhere else besides Bella Nails again, they ROCK!!!!!!!

2.0	b'Went here last weekend and was pretty disappointed. They did not have one thing that was pictured and recommended on yelp as being good. We started off with the steak grilled skewers which were just Ok, nothing special. My freind got the lasagna and I got some special chicken dish. They were both pretty bland and lacking that kick. Our waitress was really nice and got the manger to switch out our dishes. My freind got the hamburger and I got the shrimp scampi. Her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor. My scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked. With such a big name attached to this restaurant and going on such an empty stomach we had such high hopes. The service was great which is why i gave it three stars.'

He told me that he could show me the same tires I have on there now and how much they would be. When the I had taken my car to the other Discount Tire they told me it that my tread was actually still really good for how many miles I have on my car. When he told me the price of the two tires it was around $280. Which I had just bought two new ones a couple months before that and they were the same price. So when I bought the two new tires my tire pressure light came on not that long after that. I honestly feel like the tires were not even new and did not look worth $280."""

However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.\n\nOk onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries, this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.\n\nThe portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.) \n\nI bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then? Well, not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless, the chili is ok (the meat was very tough), and the service is also just ok. However, the catfish is delightful, the mac and cheese is also delicious, and the brisket is quality. \n\nThe specialty cocktails are also pretty good, and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch, after dinner drink, or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group, just make sure to call ahead. \n\nAll in all, like I said earlier, a great place for good times and smokey flavor."""
3.0	"b'One day after I satisfy my frozen yogurt craving at Kiwispoon... I get invited out to eat frozen yogurt at Piccadilly.  A rare opportunity to truly compare the two yogurt places.\n\nHere, I tried three flavors - chocolate, pumpkin, and caramel sea salt.  Added toppings of brownie bits, chocolate caramel turtles, and mochi.\n\nOverall, I liked the yogurt better at Kiwispoon. The frozen yogurt seems less rich in Piccadilly\'s and the flavors are not as strong.  The price per ounce is also marginally higher at Piccadilly\'s.\n\nThere are definitely pluses to Piccadilly\'s yogurt though.  I liked the toppings better - I thought the mochi tasted better, the brownie pieces were bigger, and the chocolate caramel turtles went great on ice cream.  The chocolate caramel turtles should be a standard topping for both frozen yogurt and ice cream places.  Also, with the huge map of Cleveland Heights behind the cash register, this feels more like an authentic ""neighborhood"" froyo joint.'"

The only good thing there was the crab legs because they're suppose to be cold and the tacos because it was freshly made. The food was under a single lamp that didn't heat the food at all. We let the server know that the food was cold and he told the manager that was in charge. All she did was come over to ask what the problem was and said she was going to talk to the chief. Have no idea what actually happened though because we didn't see her after that. Half the buffet was closed as well so there wasn't that many options. I must say i rather go to the Rio buffet.

1.0	"b'I\'ve never experienced discrimination as I did last night at this place. I was with 2 other females...we had on dresses and heels. The place was very diverse as far as how everyone was dressed. Dresses, heels, jeans, flip flops, shorts, etc. Immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside. We thought nothing of it...assumed they were all on lists. Then it just got weird. We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn\'t make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave. I know it wasn\'t because of how we were dressed or looked....they were letting people in with jeans and flip flops. Ultimately we were let in by a bouncer at a side door. There was nothing so special going on in there that they had to be ""picky"" about who they let inside. It was like a night at Suite.  Safe to say, I will never step foot in this place again.'"

We've all been in that situation. \n\nUnlimited alcohol, wines and beer. They have a bar area with one bartender working and a bunch of tv's to watch or get updates on games. \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way, but if I was in Mirage and hungry, I'd eat there if we had another 2-1 coupon.

2.0	"b'Took my kids here to hang out on one fine 72 degree sunny Saturday in February. Going over the bridge, coming from Aliante Casino, you cant miss the nice view of the waterfall that is at the forefront of the park.\n\nToo bad this and the playground were the only nice things I can vouch for. \n\nThe playground is a nice fenced in little area that has a decent amount of playground equipment, swings, slides, tables, and benches. I like the soft material they use that the playground equipment is built on. There is also a sand lot area that has dinosaur bones as props. The day we went, the playground was packed. Kids were running into each other as they went down the slides. There were kids actually waiting to get on the swings! \n\nAfter a while we decided to walk around to check out the rest of the park. We see ducks everywhere especially in the pond that has the nice waterfall going into it. Unfortunately, this is where the ""nice stuff"" ends. Everywhere on the paths we were walking on were green duck crap. Which brings the question, ""Is there some kind of spray or force field they have on the playground?"" Because there were no ducks or green duck crap anywhere in the playground. Im also curious as to how many people would actually spread out a blanket and have a picnic on the grass for the crap was all over that as well. Just doing this review im starting to get grossed out thinking about that day.\n\nAfter carefully trying not to step on any crap going to the car, I made a mental note to make sure to mention all the green crap I saw in this review and to not hesitate in mentioning it to everybody I know that is either making plans on coming here or are just thinking about it. The only thing positive I can think of about that is to come here if you are on a diet. After seeing all the green crap, you probably wont be having much of an appetite and you definitely will get some exercise trying to avoid stepping on the stuff. \n\nSo, yeah, im not worried about coming back to this place any time soon in this lifetime.

The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss.

If they were organized, and told ALL their employees customers could put their names down on a PSVR, I could have gotten a system last night.\n\nNot only did this illiminate my chances of getting a system at GameStop, but made it too late for me to go to other department stores who had stock (as they were too far away, and lines were already forming at each location). \n\nNot happy.'"
5.0	"b""This place is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. \n\nMy favorites are the Chicken Scarpariello, the pizza and the Sangria. My wife can't decide between four dishes. Our daughter loves the Penne ala Vodka, Lasagna, or Ravioli.\n\nMario and his sons work hard to please and we've never had a bad meal here. I've seen them bend over backwards to try and take care of obvious jerks. \n\nPlus to top it off, when local school invited local pizza places to present to a class on making pizza and recycling issues, Mario came and talked to the kids as if they were adults. All the other places treated it as a marketing event and brought coupons. \n\nGet the idea? It's all good at this neighborhood gem!"""

5.0	"b""Man, I love Toronto! Hiding in a strip mall on Overlea, find a dingy looking restaurant that serves up fantastic, cheap kabob...be warned regardless of when you come here you'll likely be waiting for a table as this place is always overrun with people...If you're a fan of perfectly grilled spicy meat, you must try this place out...now that I've been here I need to limit how many times I go here per month :)\n\nTake the drive out and have some kabob...if you don't own a car, borrow one or get a zipcar membership...totally worth it!"""
5.0	"b""Today was my first time seeing the staff at Bella Smile and it was a great experience.  Although I'm not currently living in Las Vegas I plan on coming back for checkups and any other problems that may arise.  There was no wait time whatsoever and I was out of there without a drop of pain or discomfort.  The manager Severn was very accommodating and will be getting business from my family and friends in town."""
4.0	"b""I've taken my kids here several times, and we've never had to wait more then 5 minutes. We go right up, sign in, and they usually call us back right as I'm done signing their paperwork. The doctors have always been super nice. My daughter had stitches done, and she was a nervous wreck. The staff tried so hard to make her comfortable and gave her a stuffed toy when she was done. It was very nice. I wish they would open a bit earlier in the day...otherwise, they're great."""
1.0	"b""One of the crappier Marriotts I've ever stayed at. The staff is nice and professional enough. But the fact that it's right by the frontage road along I-17, you tend to attract a seedier crowd. Also, with three floors worth of rooms here, guess how many washer/dryer they have for everyone? ONE crappy washer and ONE crappy dryer! Don't even think about washing your clothes on a Friday night. For a two hour period, I went to see if the washer was finally available, each time I was met with yet another load of dirty clothes inside. If they can't afford to get more machines, consider installing one of those number ticket dispensers! Just a thought. Maybe I would have a better shot of washing my clothes. I also considered sitting on top of the washer until the load was done, but that would be kind of creepy on my part. I will be packing all my dirty clothes with me and never come back here again."""
3.0	"b""Beer, beer, and more beer.  It's definitely a low-key nieghborhood bar.  As an out of towner, I enjoyed it.  It felt like Pittsburgh's version of Cheers except grimier.\n\nUnfortunately, the kitchen closes fairly early on weekdays otherwise this place may have received another star."""
4.0	b'Love the crust on this pizza. The sauce is decent, cheese is okay, the pepperoni was not the best quality. \nMy friend ordered an everything slice, said it was good, just wished so cheese was on the toppings to hold it together.'
2.0	"b""Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.\n\nFirst, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.\n\nI expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. \n\nTo top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday."""
4.0	"b""I'm not that familiar with Scottsdale so I'm just guessing that this restaurant is fairly new. The atmosphere is great and lively but s but loud. They have a huge wine and drink list. \n\nThe food was really good, I highly recommend the ahi tuna appetizer, ravioli and the skirt steak!"""
4.0	"b'""Good morning, cocktails for you?"" \nWait...what? Oh...it\'s Vegas!\n\nDining here, you best not be dieting because this place is literally the definition of excess, but in a good way. I\'m a sucker for benedicts so that was awesome. \nService was really great too and the staff was so welcoming. It was our first stop just after landing so really appreciate the service.\n\nBack in Hawaii this reminds me of Zippys or Anna Millers - that home feeling. Prices are a bit high, but for what you get it\'s totally worth it. Will remember this place if I ever return to Vegas in the future.'"
5.0	"b'Hands down best Bloody Mary ever. So many things in my BM, veggies  mmm bacon.  ""Nailed it"" it\'s an appetizer. I also had the burger with fries. Who knew fries could be so good. The presentation doesn\'t disappoint ether. Very nice. Great seating outside although we sat inside. Would love to see this restaurant near my hometown. Seriously. Get the BM. You rock Guy!'"
